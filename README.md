# Docker overview
  A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications with Fast, Consistent delivery of applications.
 
# Responsive Deployment and Scaling
  Dockerâ€™s portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads. 
  Scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business in near real time.
  
# Running more workloads on the same hardware
  Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hypervisor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your compute capacity
  to achieve your business goals.
  Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with fewer resources.

  # To remove the container when the container can't stop
        docker rm --force <container ID> or <Name>
        
  # To see the container log
        docker logs <container ID> or <Name>
        
  # To see the container disk size
        docker ps -s  
       
  # To see the container CPU and RAM utilization
        docker stats
        
  # To publish the container port number to access by browser: -P assign the port dynamically
        docker run -d -P <Image>:<version>
        
  # To publish the contianer port number to access by browser with own port
        docker run -d -p <custom port>:<port where container running> <Image>:<version>
        
  # To login to the container for debuging  it - Intractive Terminal
        docker exec -it <container ID> /bin/bash
        
  # To inspect the Image
        docker image inspect <image-name>:<version>
